Code for paper "How to optimize student learning using student models that adapt rapidly to individual differences".
General idea is that population parameters will necessarily lead to systematic errors, that can be tracked and used as predictors.
Code is either simulations or analysis of existing data using LKT to fit regularized logistic regression models.
Will be expanding on this code in coming weeks to make it easier to use.
